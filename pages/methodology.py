    This page provides a comprehensive overview of the data flows and implementation details used in the application.
    The methodology covers data extraction, AI model utilization, and compliance checks through a structured flow.
    
    **Data Flows and Implementation Details**:
    - The project uses various Google Cloud services to store and manage the data (e.g., GCS for document storage).
    - AI Agents are responsible for parsing, analyzing, and validating information extracted from input documents.
    
    **Flowchart**:
    Below are flowcharts illustrating the process flow for each use case in the application:
    
    1. **Chat with Information**: Represents the flow where users interact with the AI to gain insights from regulatory documents.
    2. **Intelligent Search**: Shows the process of extracting and searching for specific requirements or standards from the documents.
