            The project was developed as the final assignment for the AI Bootcamp under the Project B category to address key challenges in the building and construction industry. 
            Key question: 
            How can we simplify and automate repetitive checks, reduce non-compliance risks, and improve workflows to ease the work burden on project stakeholders?

            Use Case:
            - Develop a Proof of Concept (PoC) to demonstrate the solutionâ€™s feasibility by using a common component, such as windows or doors, and verifying its compliance with specified requirements, including BCA-approved documents and SCDF Fire Code 2023 regulations.
 
            Objectives:

            - Improve compliance checks through automation
            - Streamline document parsing to reduce manual workload
            - Deliver AI-driven recommendations to accelerate design and checking processes
                        
            Scope:

            - Focus on window schedules, BCA-approved documents, and SCDF requirements and use these datasets as defaults for testing and refinement
                        
            Strategies:

            - Employ AI agents, LLMs, and different AI models to enhance efficiency and accuracy
            - Use non-sensitive data and host it on public cloud platforms, such as Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and GitHub
            - Use Streamlit for rapid website development
                        
            Benefits:

            - Saves time by simplifying the understanding of regulatory requirements
            - Reduces manual work in design checks with real-time guidance
            - Modular functions allow for continuous updates and further development
                        
            Data:

            - Window Schedule (jpeg format)
            - BCA Approved Documents, SCDF Fire Code 2023 Chapter 4 (pdf format)
            - Documents from users or generated output (xls and/or txt formats)
                        
            Features:

            - AI-driven parsing and tabulation of design requirements with Google AI model gemini-1.5-pro-002
            - Automated data processing, analysis, and generation of recommendations for design compliance considerations with Google AI model gemini-1.5-pro-002
            - Interactive interface for regulatory requirement checks and validations using OpenAI model gpt-4o-mini
