            This project was developed for learning purposes as the final assignment for the GovTech AI Bootcamp under the Project B category, with an aim to address real challenges in the construction industry. 
            Below are some of the considerations outlined for this project.
            
            Key question: 

            - How can we simplify and automate repetitive checks, reduce non-compliance risks, and improve workflows to ease the work burden on project stakeholders?
            (referencing [AI Hackathon](https://www.aihackathon.pro/p/topics.html) topic 1)

            Objective:

            - Develop a scalable Proof of Concept (PoC) using a common building component to demonstrate how an AI-powered solution can automate repetitive checks, reduce non-compliance risks and manual workloads.
            
            PoC Scope:

            - Use a window schedule as the design intent to check for compliance with relevant BCA-approved documents and SCDF Chapter 4 requirements.

            PoC Benefits:

            - Work Efficiency: Simplifies understanding of regulatory requirements, speeding up design processes.
            - Reduced Manual Effort: Automates design checks, providing real-time guidance and feedback.
            - Scalability: Modular functions allow for continuous updates and further development.

            PoC Strategies:

            - AI-Driven Workflow: Use AI tools and language models to improve efficiency and accuracy in compliance checks.
            - Simple Data Hosting: Store non-sensitive data on Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and GitHub for scalable and easy cloud setup.
            - Fast Web Development: Use Streamlit for quick, interactive website creation to enhance user experience.

            PoC Data:

            - Input: Window schedules (JPEG format), BCA-approved documents, and SCDF Fire Code 2023 Chapter 4 (PDF format).
            - Output: Processed documents and recommendations (XLS and/or TXT formats) generated by AI models.
 
            PoC Features:

            - AI-Driven Parsing: Automated extraction and tabulation of design requirements using Google AI model Gemini-1.5-Pro-002
            - Data Analysis & Recommendations: AI-powered data processing to analyze compliance and generate design recommendations
            - Interactive Validation Interface: Real-time regulatory checks using OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o-Mini model for enhanced user interaction
