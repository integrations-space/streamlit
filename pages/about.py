            **Background**: Developed as the final assignment for the AI Bootcamp under the Project B category, this project leverages AI, large language models (LLMs), and online tools to address key challenges in the building and construction industry.
            
            **Objective**: This project aims to enhance the analysis of technical and regulatory requirements in the building and construction industry by improving compliance checks, automating document parsing, and providing AI-driven recommendations.
            
            **Benefits**: This approach helps professionals save time and gain a quicker understanding of regulatory requirements, streamlining design checks. With up-to-date project and regulatory datasets, it offers real-time guidance, identifies potential compliance issues, and provides continuously updated recommendations, transforming manual tasks into efficient, AI-driven workflows.
            
            **Scope**: The project covers regulatory requirements parsing, compliance checks, and validation using a sample dataset, including a window schedule, BCA-approved documents, and a segment of SCDF requirements as default datasets.
            
            **Strategies**: The solution explores modern AI tools, such as OpenAI and Vertex AI, using AI agents and large language models (LLMs) to replace conventional functions where applicable.
            
            **Data**: The project uses technical drawings (JPEG format), regulatory requirements (PDF format), and documents (Excel and txt formats), all hosted in Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
            
            **Features**:
            
            - AI-driven parsing and tabulation of design requirements.
            - Compliance analysis and generation of non-compliance recommendations.
            - Interactive interface for regulatory requirement checks and validations.
