    This project aims to provide a structured approach to analyzing technical and regulatory requirements in the building and construction industry. 
    Our key objectives include improving compliance checks, automating document parsing, and providing AI-driven recommendations to streamline the design and approval process.
    
    **Project Scope**: Covers regulatory requirements parsing, compliance checks, and validation using modern AI tools such as OpenAI and Vertex AI.
    
    **Data Sources**: Using technical drawings (jpg), regulatory requirements (pdf) and documents (xls & txt) hosted in Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
    
    **Features**:
    - AI-driven parsing and tabulation of design requirements.
    - Compliance analysis and non-compliance recommendation generation.
    - Interactive interface for regulatory requirement checks and validations.
