    This script demonstrates:
    1. Reading jpeg drawings and pdf data (use case as window/door schedule)
    2. Parsing it into a structured format
    3. Converting to a pandas DataFrame for analysis
    4. Performing basic calculations as analysis and recommendation
    5. Exporting the outputs into Excel files
