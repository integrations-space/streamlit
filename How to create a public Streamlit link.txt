What:
Deploy the app.py script from GitHub and make it publicly accessible via Streamlit Cloud.

Why:
Streamlit Cloud is a simple and powerful way to deploy Python scripts (like the one using streamlit) as interactive web applications. 
It allows public access to the app through a sharable link, which is useful for demonstrations or collaboration.

How:
Follow these steps to deploy your Streamlit app:

Sign in to Streamlit Cloud:
Go to Streamlit Cloud (https://streamlit.io/cloud) and sign in using your GitHub account.

Create a New App:
Once logged in, click on the New App button on your dashboard.

Connect to the GitHub Repository:
Select the repository that contains your script: integrations-space/streamlit.
In the Branch section, choose the branch (likely main).
In the App File section, enter the path to your Streamlit script: streamlit_app.py.

Deploy the App:
Click Deploy. This will set up the app, install necessary dependencies, and make it publicly available.

Share the Link:
Once deployed, Streamlit will generate a public URL for your app. You can share this link with others so they can run and interact with the app.

Impact:
Your app will be accessible to anyone with the link.
You can run the app in real-time from any browser, even on mobile devices.
This approach scales well for lightweight apps that require minimal server configuration.

Actionable Recommendations:
Ensure the necessary dependencies (ifcopenshell, pandas, plotly, etc.) are listed in a requirements.txt file in your repository to avoid issues during deployment.
Use Streamlit Cloudâ€™s free tier for small projects, but for larger apps or frequent access, consider upgrading to a paid plan.
Test the app thoroughly to ensure it handles all required inputs and dependencies smoothly.

Example:
Once deployed, the link would look something like: https://share.streamlit.io/integrations-space/streamlit/main/streamlit_app.py.

Conclusion:
By following these steps, you can easily make your Python script publicly accessible via Streamlit Cloud, allowing anyone to interact with it through a simple link.
